# App-to-Log-Gym-Progress
A basic app using SQL and Python the track my gym progress, as well as some machine learning algorithms to predict progress,
and deliver personalised recommendations. This is slightly different to the one I use myself, the csv files are auto generated, 
just so I could test the machine learning models. I will continue to make adjustments as I enter live data.

**Core Functions**
- Log Workouts: Specific exercises, sets, reps, weight, and mood
- Exercise Catalogue: Create a list of exercises based on muscle groups
- Log Weight: Enter current weight and visualise progress over time
- Mood Tracking: See how workouts impact moood
- Data Visualisation: View progress and insigths
- Predict progress: Predict days until target weight

**Machine Learning Insights**
- Weight Prediction: Predict days until target weight
- Progress Analysis: Identify which factors(time, reps, exercise, moods) contribute most to progress

**Analytics Dashboard**
- Dynamic graphs for exercise performance
- Horizontal bar charts ranking workout frequency and volume

**Technologies Used**
- Python3
- CustomTkinter
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Pyodbc
- Microsoft SQL Server
